    <h2>Stop Shootings as a Whole</h2>
    <p>While we cannot directly attempt to stop a shooting, we can help reduce potential
    shootings by recognizing signs of such actions early on. Thus, by raising awareness
    and working together to identify and resolve the signs, we can address rge issues of
    shootings</p>
 
      <h2>Get the goverment involved</h2>
      <p> For the past few years, very little governmental legislation or restriction has
      been enacted or implemented, and thus shootings continue to be a unfortunate part of
      our daily lives. However, this is at least on some level readily preventable by gun 
      control legislation laws when put in. By advocating for this legislation and helping 
      our government pass legislation against guns and for gun regulations, we will be able 
      to take a stand against shootings and a step towards prevention of shootings</p>
      
      <h2>Help the mentally ill</h2>
        <p> Many of our shootings in recent times have been caused by those who are not fit
        in mind and should not be carrying a gun. Thus, while we must enact legislation to 
        prevent guns falling into the wrong hands, we must also have programs to help those 
        of us who are unable to receive the help they need.</p>
